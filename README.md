Create a new README.md in the root that explains the overall project and folder structure.
In frontend/, move the existing HTML, CSS and JS files into this folder. Add a README.md that explains how to deploy via GitHub Pages.
In backend/, add: • supabase.js — exports the Supabase URL and anon key and initializes the client. • schema.sql — contains SQL statements to create the required tables: inventory_entries and stock_exits, with columns matching the UI. Include primary keys and appropriate data types. • README.md explaining how to run the SQL script against your Supabase instance.
